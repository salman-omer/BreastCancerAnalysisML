Breast Cancer Analysis python

Uses breast cancer data obtained from UCI datasets to demonstrate understanding of basic machine learning and data analysis
concepts in regards to categorical data.

This script allows for the programmer to input categorical data with various inputted algorithms for preprocessing that data.
This means that multiple sets of analysis can be done on the data with different preprocessing parameters which can then be 
checked later to find which model fits the validation dataset the best. 

This demonstrates a basic understanding of preprocessing techniques as well as simple algorithms to be used on certain datasets.
I have not done the analysis on how useful this data is because I am not familiar with what kind of prediction rate is acceptable
for such cancer data.

I have used this type of analysis on other, simpler UCI datasets with a writeups. I have no completed a write up for this, but
the various results of the program can be seen.
